        // this is method chaining! or cascade ...
        // we “chain” methods together with periods
        // and this let's us perform several actions in a single line of code! woah!
        // wait wait ... backup, method? cascade? you mean the cleaner? the dishsoap? no!

        // methods are functions that belong to objects!

        // a method is just a piece of code - called by name  - that is associated with an object.

        // "method" is just another word for "function" EXCEPT that methods are implicitly passed
        // to the object for which they were called.

        // methods are able to operate on the data within the class.

        // methods are designed to operate directly on the
        // properties of the object to which they belong.

        // each method returns a selection which
        // in turn has more methods that return a selection.

        // and a selection is an array of elements that have 
        // special methods that allow us data nerds to
        // perform operations on all the elements within a selection.

        // remember! an object is an instance of a class ...
        // and the class is just defining that object ... 
        // and an object is an instance of that data!

        // lastly to save hours of dubugging - remember that ORDER matters!
        // when one method sends something down the chain, that output has to
        // MATCH the input type for the next method in the chain.
        // it's like a relay race, if you can't pass the baton, you can't
        // finish the race. \(T_T)/
